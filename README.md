Introduction
Remember Tic Tac Toe (also known as “Noughts and Crosses”)? It involves a couple of players, a board, checking for victory in a game loop… all the conditions that make it a fun little problem to solve using our newfound OOP sea legs. Let’s build it!

Assignment
Build a tic-tac-toe game on the command line where two human players can play against each other and the board is displayed in between turns.

Think about how you would set up the different elements within the game… What should be a class? Instance variable? Method? A few minutes of thought can save you from wasting an hour of coding.
Build your game, taking care to not share information between classes any more than you have to.
